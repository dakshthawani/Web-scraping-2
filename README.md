## Project Overview
This script scrapes the headlines (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) from a given Wikipedia page, extracts them using a defined YAML configuration file (`extract.yaml`), and stores the extracted data in `data.txt`. The project uses the `requests` and `selectorlib` libraries.

## Requirements

- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `selectorlib`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install requests selectorlib
```
